##Data Extraction
The data used for the Movie Rental Analysis Power BI Report was extracted from the Sakila MySQL Database, a structured and relational data source representing a DVD rental storeâ€™s operation. The extraction process involved connecting Power BI directly to the MySQL server to retrieve, transform, and prepare the required tables for analysis. This process ensured that the data was clean, consistent, and optimized for creating interactive dashboards that deliver accurate business insights. The data extraction phase served as the foundation for all subsequent modelling, visualization, and reporting steps.
